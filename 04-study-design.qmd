# Assignment 4: Study designs


## Overview
Choose an area of interest (e.g. protein supplementation for muscle hypertrophy or the effect of block
periodization on VO<sub>2max</sub>). Find at least five *original research studies*^[Avoid using review articles or meta-analyses] in your selected area and describe strength and weakness of these studies. The report should focus on the design of the studies and selection of statistical tests to answer study aims.
Conclude your report with a recommendation, how should future studies in your area be designed to best
answer similar questions?

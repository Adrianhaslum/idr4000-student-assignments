A simple, and very common way to analyze the relationship between exercise intensity and blood lactate is to determine exercise intensity at fixed blood lactate values. This can be done by fitting a regression model that captures the relationship and then “inverse predict” the exercise intensity value. An example of such inverse prediction can be found in the lecture notes.\nYour report should use data from the reliability project in the lab. Calculate at least two lactate thresholds (e.g. exercise intensity at 2 and 4 mmol L-1) and compare the reliability (typical error as a percentage of the mean) between the two thresholds. If you want to complicate things further you may want to implement other lactate threshold concepts (described in Tanner and Gore 2012; Newell et al. 2007).",

    "text": "3.1 Setting up a simulation\nIn this assignment we will simulate a population of possible values, from this population we will draw random samples, calculate statistics and interpret them. The population of values can be regarded as the possible differences between two treatments in a cross-over study where participants have performed both treatments. The values in the population are calculate as \\(Treatment - Control\\).\nWe will simulate a population of one million numbers with a mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 3. We will make two different set of studies, one set with a sample size of 8 and one set with a sample size of 40. In order to be sure you replicate your results, include and run set.seed() before simulations in your final script.\nWe will use the lm function to estimate the average value of the population. We do this in an “intercept-only” model. This model can be written as\n\\[Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept and can be interpreted as the average value of \\(Y\\), our dependent variable. \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, each observation (\\(i\\)) deviates from the intercept to some degree. If the intercept term is positive or negative we can interpret it as a difference between the two treatments (described above). This model is equivalent to a one-sample t-test. Let’s get started!\nIn the code chunk below, we will simulate the population of differences between treatments. We will then draw two random samples corresponding sample sizes of 8 and 40 and save these data in data frames with the dependent variable named y. We fit the very simple model y ~ 1 as a linear model and save the model object as m1 and m2.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(1)\npopulation &lt;- rnorm(1000000, mean = 1.5, sd = 3)\n\n\nsamp1 &lt;- data.frame(y = sample(population, 8, replace = FALSE))\n\nsamp2 &lt;- data.frame(y = sample(population, 40, replace = FALSE))\n\n\nm1 &lt;- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp1)\nm2 &lt;- lm(y ~ 1, data = samp2)\n\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ 1, data = samp1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-6.5322 -1.2523 -0.0883  1.3540  4.8692 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)\n(Intercept)    1.840      1.251    1.47    0.185\n\nResidual standard error: 3.539 on 7 degrees of freedom\nThe results from a simple model can be calculated by hand. The Estimate corresponds to the average of all values in the sample, from the smaller sample, samp1 we can do mean(samp1$y). This average should correspond to coef(m1) which should be 1.84. The variation of the data is most often described with the standard deviation (SD). The SD of y in the smaller sample is sd(samp1$y) (corresponding to 3.539). However, the regression table (summary(m1)) show you the standard error (SE). This statistic is an attempt to estimate the variation in a hypothetical distribution of means. The standard error is (in this simple case) \\(SE_y = \\frac{SD_y}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Calculating by hand using the data in samp1 we would do sd(samp1$y)/sqrt(8). Amazingly this corresponds to 1.251!\nBy using the estimate 1.84 and the corresponding SE (1.251) we can calculate the t-value as the ratio \\(\\frac{Estimate}{SE}\\). The t-value may in turn be used to determine the are under the curve of a t-distribution. The t-value from the above calculation is 1.4702611. Using our single \\(n=8\\) study, we estimate that values of t, as extreme or even more extreme as our observed value both above and below 0, would occur in 18.5% of studies if the null-hypothesis was true. This corresponds to a p-value of 0.185. The figure below shows a graphical representation of a t-value distribution under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true.\nA t-distribution estimated from model m1 with the shaded area corresponding to the observed p-value.",

    "section": "5.6 Organizing the report",
    "text": "5.6 Organizing the report\nYour report should consist of the sections Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion. Each part of the report should be written as a reproducible document and a link or reference to the repository containing the source document(s) should be included in the report. Below follows detailed descriptions and requirements for each section.\n\n5.6.1 Introduction\nThis section should consist of a description of the field, resistance-training volume and muscle strength and mass. Use at least five to ten references to introduce your audience and explain why you are doing the analysis/study. A tip is to use the QALMRI method, introduced in Assignment 4 to structure the reading of background information. It is up to you how you motivate the study and how you phrase the purpose of the study. It could be a hypothesis based on previous studies, it could also be question to fill a knowledge gap that you have identified in your literature review.\nStructure the introduction in paragraphs. A first paragraph could contain a general introduction to the field, why is it of interest to investigate resistance-training? A second paragraph could specifically describe the specific field of resistance-training volume, why is important to know more about how we are likely to respond to different training volumes. The second paragraph should incorporate definitions important for your report, e.g., training volume, muscle mass and strength. Try to incorporate these definition as a fluid part of the text.\nA third (or last) paragraph of the introduction should contain a statement regarding the purpose of the study. The purpose could be descriptive, hypothesis-driven or guided by a question. Although it could be considered a bit backward, you should explore the data sets before you select your question/hypothesis/purpose for it to be possible to answer.\n\n\n5.6.2 Methods\nThe method should give a thorough overview of the study and specific details regarding data collection. You can read about the details of this specific study in (Hammarström et al. 2020). Use your own words to describe the study based on this description. A nice way to structure the methods section is to include subheadings:\n\nParticipants and study overview: Describe the participants and give an overview of all tests/measurements. Participants should be described in the first table of the report (Table 1). The overview of the tests/measurements should be done without double presentation as details should be presented in subsequent sections.\nSpecific descriptions (e.g. strength tests): Describe in detail how tests/measurements that you mentioned in the overview where conducted.\nData analysis and statistics: Describe how you treated the data prior to statistical tests or procedures and what tests/procedures were used to draw inference (or more generally, to answer your purpose). Describe how you present data (e.g. descriptive data with mean (SD), inference with confidence intervals etc.).\n\n\n\n5.6.3 Results\nDescribe the results of your analysis. This description should make use of table and figures as well as a text that guides and structures the content to the reader. Think about it this way, the text should describe when and how to read the figures and tables. This means that all aspects of the results should be covered in the text. The figures and tables should also be “self explanatory”, this means that you have to include descriptive figure captions and descriptions of tables (see below for tips).\nAs the main purpose of the analysis should concern the effect of training volume on muscle mass and strength, it is natural that the comparison of training outcomes between volume conditions is the main analysis in the results. You may also have questions regarding the relationship between muscle strength and mass gains, if there are differences between men and women etc. Selection of statistical/analysis techniques should reflect the study question/purpose.\n\n\n5.6.4 Discussion\nStructure the discussion with a first paragraph describing the main results of the analysis, this could be the answer to your question or a statement regarding the study hypothesis. In the following paragraphs discuss all results that you have presented in the light of previous studies. It is your job to give the reader plausible interpretations and explanations of your results. This is how single scientific results are incorporated in our collective understanding. These interpretations can later be challenged, however if you give the reader good arguments and clear descriptions, your insights will be valuable to collective reasoning even if they turn out to be wrong in light of new data.\nEnd the discussion with a summary or conclusion. Some journals request that you state your conclusions under a specific heading in the end of the report/article.",
